# Poetry Analysis

The aim of this project is to create a Java application that is capable of reading and identifying several literary features including:

- Rhyme Scheme
- Alliteration

The user will be able to do this by submitting their current prose as a text file and then running the program from the CLI to recieve interactive feedback about the features identified by the system.
